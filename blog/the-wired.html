      <h1>The Wired</h1>
      <p>
        The Wired is the 3D web. It is the 3D representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia"
          target="_blank">hypermedia</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Hypermedia Functor (F: 2D -&gt; 3D)</h2>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>F</th>
          <th>2D</th>
          <th>3D</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Category</td>

          <td>Wired</td>

          <td>Object</td>
          <td>Website (HTML + JS)</td>
          <td>World (glTF + WASM)</td>

          <td>Morphism</td>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Space</h2>
      <p>
        An important distinction here is the difference between a 2D page and a 3D space, from the perspective of a
        human.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 2D page (a piece of paper) cannot meaningfully be inhabited by a 3D being (a human). The best you can do
        is projection — reducing the entity's dimensionality to a 2D icon (mouse cursor, profile picture) or even a 1D
        point (tip of a pencil).
      </p>
      <p>
        This has obvious flaws if your goal is self-expression (or any downstream goal from this, such as
        communication). Put in other words, The Web offers <em>symbolic</em> reality, whereas The Wired offers
        <em>embodied</em> reality.
      </p>

      <h2>Multi-tenancy</h2>
      <p>
        Any embodied space, by its nature<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>, admits
        the possibility of multiple tenants.
        This is a
        structural property of
        navigable environments. Because of this, The Wired represents hypermedia as an inherently shared space — a
        multiplayer environment — as opposed to the isolated pages of The Web.
      </p>

      <h2>Humanism</h2>
      <p>
        All of this combines to make The Wired a much more "human" interface for information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to think this will help push back against the growing negatives of our reliance on technology — creating
        a medium where people speak with their voice, arm movements, and facial expressions — not text;
        where people see with their eyes and interact with their hands — not a manufactured image or uninteractive
        video;
        where people dance with their bodies — not a purchased emote or reaction GIF.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, a stronger embodiment (or entrapment) of the soul within metal may only serve to make things worse.
